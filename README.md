# 📌 Mapping Ideological Communities on Weibo During Public Controversies

## 📝 Project Description

This project investigates how ideologically conservative (e.g., nationalists, anti-feminists) and progressive (e.g., feminists, LGBTQ+ activists) user communities on Weibo differ in their patterns of social network formation, internal cohesion, and cross-group interaction, compared to the general public. Using event-driven data scraping, co-occurrence-based user labeling, and social network analysis (SNA), the project aims to uncover structural differences that reflect ideological polarization during gender- or politics-related public controversies.

We focus on events that:
- Enter Weibo’s Top 10 trending topics
- Receive 100,000+ public interactions (likes, reposts, comments)
- Involve issues of gender, sexuality, or political representation

The final network analyses compare three ideological groups (progressive, conservative, general public) in terms of centrality, modularity, clustering, and cross-group interaction patterns.
