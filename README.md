# Mapping Ideological Communities on Weibo During Public Controversies
üìù Project Description / Abstract
This project investigates how ideologically conservative (e.g., nationalists, anti-feminists) and progressive (e.g., feminists, LGBTQ+ activists) user communities on Weibo differ in their patterns of social network formation, internal cohesion, and cross-group interaction, compared to the general public. Using event-driven data scraping, content-based and interaction-based user labeling, and social network analysis, the project aims to uncover structural differences that reflect patterns of polarization during highly contentious public controversies.

Key concepts: online polarization, ideological networks, Chinese social media, SNA, controversy, hashtag co-occurrence.
